# Console Script Setup

Optionally, your package can include a console script using [Fire].

# How It Works

If the `command_line_interface` option is set to `fire` during setup, cookiecutter
will add a file `cli.py` in the `project_slug` subdirectory. An entry point is added to
`pyproject.toml` that points to the main function in `cli.py`.

# Usage

To use the console script in development:

```bash
poetry install
```

`projectdir` should be the top level project directory with the `pyproject.toml` file.

Then execute:
```
$your_package_name help
```

It will show your package name, project short description and exit.
